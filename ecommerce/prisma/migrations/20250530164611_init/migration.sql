  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Product` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to alter the column `id` on the `Product` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `String` to `Int`.
  - You are about to alter the column `price` on the `Product` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Int` to `Float`.
  - Made the column `category` on table `Product` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
